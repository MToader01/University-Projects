# Static Routing and Subnetting Configuration

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates the configuration of static routing and subnetting for a network setup using Cisco devices. It involves the design of IP addressing, subnetting, and static routing across multiple routers and LANs. The configuration files for routers and detailed subnet plans are included.

## Project Description
The **Static Routing and Subnetting Configuration** project is a network topology where multiple routers (R1 to R5) are configured with static routes and appropriate subnetting to manage traffic between LANs and WANs. This project simulates a real-world networking scenario where routing must be manually configured to ensure communication between different network segments.

The project includes:
- **Subnetting Plan**: IP address allocations and subnet details for the network.
- **Static Routing**: Routes configured on each router to facilitate traffic between different networks.
- **Configuration Files**: Detailed tables and routing commands used for each router and subnet.

## Features
- **Static Routing**: Manual configuration of routes for each router (R1 to R5) to direct traffic between different LANs and WANs.
- **Subnetting**: The project defines how IP ranges are divided and assigned to different networks, ensuring efficient use of IP addresses.
- **Routing Tables**: Each router has routing tables configured to handle traffic based on the network architecture.

## Installation and Setup
This project requires the use of Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the network topology.

1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Open the provided `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Review the IP addressing, subnetting, and routing tables from the included `Tabela_de_adresare.txt`, `Tabela_de_rutare.txt`, and `Tabela_de_subnetare.txt` files.

## Usage
1. Load the network configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Verify the IP addressing and subnetting scheme.
3. Check each router's static routes to ensure proper communication between different network segments.
4. Ping devices across different LANs and WANs to test connectivity.

## Project Structure
- **Routing Tables**: Includes the static routes configured for each router (R1 to R5).
- **Subnetting**: Detailed subnetting plan, with the IP ranges for each LAN and WAN.
- **Device Configuration**: IP addressing scheme and gateway assignments for each device (routers, switches, PCs).
- **Simulation File**: `.pkt` file to simulate the network setup in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For simulating the network topology.
- **IP Subnetting**: To efficiently divide IP address ranges across different network segments.
- **Static Routing**: Manual configuration of routing paths between different network segments.
