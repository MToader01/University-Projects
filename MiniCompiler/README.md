Python Compiler Project
Summary
This project is a simple Python-based compiler, including components for lexical analysis, parsing, interpretation, and token management. It demonstrates how a compiler can be built using Python from the ground up.

Project Description
The Python Compiler Project consists of several components that together form a working compiler. It includes a lexer (lexical analyzer), parser, and interpreter that take input in a custom language or format, process it, and provide output. This project is useful for understanding the fundamental stages of compiling and interpreting code.

The project is designed to demonstrate how compilers work at a basic level using Python.

Features
Lexical Analysis: The lexer.py file breaks down the input into tokens.
Parsing: The parse.py file interprets the structure of the tokens and checks for correctness.
Interpretation: The interpreter.py file evaluates the parsed code and executes it.
Shell: A shell.py file is provided to execute the compiler interactively.
Token Management: The tokens.py file defines various token types used by the lexer.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PythonCompilerProject.git
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.x).
Navigate to the project directory.
Usage
Run the shell.py file to interact with the compiler.
Copy code
python shell.py
Input code into the shell, and the compiler will lex, parse, and interpret the code.
Output will be generated based on the provided input code.
